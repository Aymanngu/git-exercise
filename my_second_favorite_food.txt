Fresh and Flavorful Salad Recipe

Ingredients:

4 cups mixed salad greens (e.g., romaine, arugula, and spinach)
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cucumber, sliced
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
1 avocado, diced
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional)
1/4 cup sliced almonds or walnuts (optional)
For the Dressing:

3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar or lemon juice
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
Salt and pepper, to taste
Instructions:

Prepare the Salad Ingredients:
Rinse and dry the salad greens. Tear any large leaves into bite-sized pieces and place them in a large salad bowl.

Add the cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, avocado, and any other optional ingredients like feta cheese or nuts.

Make the Dressing:
In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar (or lemon juice), Dijon mustard, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.

Combine and Toss:
Pour the dressing over the salad and toss everything gently to coat the ingredients evenly. Make sure the avocado is well-coated to prevent browning.

Serve and Enjoy:
Serve immediately as a fresh, light meal or a side dish. For added protein, top with grilled chicken, shrimp, or chickpeas if desired.
