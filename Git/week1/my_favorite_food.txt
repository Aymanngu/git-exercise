Homemade French Fries Recipe

Ingredients:

4 large russet potatoes
4 cups vegetable oil (for frying)
Salt (to taste)
Optional: Paprika, garlic powder, or herbs for extra flavor
Instructions:

Prepare the Potatoes:
Peel the potatoes (optional) and cut them into thin, even strips, about ¼ inch thick. Thinner strips will be crispier, while thicker ones will be softer inside.

Soak the Potatoes:
Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water and let them soak for at least 30 minutes. This step helps remove excess starch and makes the fries crispier. For best results, soak for 1-2 hours or even overnight in the refrigerator.

Dry the Potatoes:
Drain the potatoes and spread them on a clean towel or paper towels. Pat them dry thoroughly—any moisture left will cause oil splatter and make the fries less crispy.

Heat the Oil:
In a deep pot or fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 325°F (163°C). Use a thermometer to keep the oil temperature steady for best results.

First Fry:
Carefully add the potatoes to the oil in small batches, frying them for about 3-5 minutes, or until they start to soften but remain pale. Remove the fries with a slotted spoon and let them drain on a paper towel-lined plate.

Second Fry:
Increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C). Once hot, return the fries to the oil in batches and fry them again for 2-4 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.
Season and Serve:

Remove the fries from the oil, let them drain briefly on paper towels, and immediately sprinkle with salt. For extra flavor, add a dash of paprika, garlic powder, or fresh herbs.

Enjoy!
Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce!
